Help Us Replace Harmful Language and Outdated Subject Headings in the Catalog

NYU Libraries has launched the Changing the Subject project (Google Doc) to remove harmful and outdated subject headings in our catalog.

Report harmful language via the online form, or through the "Provide Feedback" link in the submenu of every page in the catalog.

Collections Access
In-person access to library stacks: If an item says "Available" in one of our libraries, you may get items directly from the stacks (does not include "Offsite" items).
Requesting for locker pick-up, delivery, or digital scan is available, but may not be your fastest option. For details, visit the Collections Access page.
What option should I choose?
If you need your item today and it is "Available" in the catalog, you can go directly to the stacks and get the item off the shelf. Use our maps to help navigate the stacks.
If you can wait 3-5 days, request locker pick-up.
If there is no digital version and you do not need the full item, request a scan of 1-2 chapters.
